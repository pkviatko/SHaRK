__SHaRK__ (Sequence Handling and Resampling Kit) is an aplication written in Python to make data cleaning, primary processing and resampling of sequence files much easier and faster.

The app is still far from flawless (and probably, will ever be) and is in the process of active development.
Releases are coming soon, as well as updates to this repository.
